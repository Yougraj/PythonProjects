# WhatsApp Web Desktop App Installer

Create a dedicated **WhatsApp Web Desktop App** for Linux in just a few steps! This guide and script use **Python**, **PyInstaller**, and **QtWebEngine** to set up a standalone WhatsApp Web application with a custom icon and system integration.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyQt6 and PyQt6-WebEngine libraries
- PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`)
- A WhatsApp icon image (`WhatsApp.png`)

### 🛠️ Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the app or use the provided `install_whatsapp_app.sh` script to automate everything.

---

### 📦 1. Package the App Using PyInstaller

First, convert your Python script (`WhatsApp.py`) into a standalone executable with PyInstaller. This command will also add an icon to the app.

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=WhatsApp.png WhatsApp.py
```

- **`--onefile`**: Packages everything into a single executable.
- **`--windowed`**: Hides the terminal window (for GUI apps).
- **`--icon=WhatsApp.png`**: Sets the app icon.

---

### 🚚 2. Move the Executable to a System Path

Once packaged, move the executable to a system directory (like `/usr/local/bin`) so it can be launched from anywhere.

```bash
sudo mv dist/WhatsApp /usr/local/bin/whatsapp_app
```

---

### 📝 3. Create a .desktop File for System Integration

To integrate the app with your application menu, create a `.desktop` entry file.

1. Open a new `.desktop` file in `/usr/share/applications`:

   ```bash
   sudo nvim /usr/share/applications/whatsapp_app.desktop
   ```

2. Add the following content, replacing `/path/to/WhatsApp.png` with the path to your icon file:

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Version=1.0
   Name=WhatsApp Web
   Comment=Desktop app for WhatsApp Web
   Exec=/usr/local/bin/whatsapp_app
   Icon=/path/to/WhatsApp.png
   Terminal=false
   Type=Application
   Categories=Network;Chat;
   ```

---

### 📄 Automate Everything with a Script

To streamline the setup, use the provided `install_whatsapp_app.sh` script, which handles packaging, file placement, and .desktop entry creation.

```bash
chmod +x install_whatsapp_app.sh
./install_whatsapp_app.sh
```

---

### 🎉 Finished!

Once completed, **WhatsApp Web** will appear in your applications menu, ready to use with your custom icon. Enjoy chatting on WhatsApp Web right from your desktop!
